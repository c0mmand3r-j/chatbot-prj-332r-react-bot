# Project 332r Boiler Template - React Component

A hidden chatbot powered by OpenAI and built with React.
ML - 'hidden'

## Starting the build...

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your ChatGPT API key:

4. Run the app in development mode using `npm start`. This should open the app in your default browser and you should see the chatbot interface.

## Customizing the 332r

To customize the chatbot with your own information, you can modify the `Chatbot` component in the `src/Chatbot.js` file. Here are some things that you might want to customize:

- The welcome message that is displayed when the app first loads.
- The styling and layout of the chat window and user input field.
- The prompt that is sent to the ChatGPT API to generate responses.
- The way that the response data is parsed and displayed in the chat window.

You can also modify the `package.json` file to add any additional dependencies or scripts that you need for your specific use case.

## Deploying the 332r Chatbot

To deploy the chatbot to a hosting platform, you can use the `npm build` command to build a production-ready version of the app. This will create a `build` directory in the project root that contains the compiled code.

You can then upload this `build` directory to your hosting platform of choice, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Heroku. Be sure to follow the specific deployment instructions for your chosen platform to ensure that your chatbot is accessible and working properly.
